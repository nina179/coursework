    "# Lab 2: Decision Trees & Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due: October 3rd at 11:59pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "This lab is intended to introduce reading data from files, the use of discrete data, and the implementation of decision trees, both individually and in ensembles.  As with any programming assignment, you'll also be practicing and improving your general CS skills, like problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, implementation and testing, language syntax, etc..  Here are some of the specific things you should learn while completing this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to load and work with data from a CSV file using the Pandas library\n",
    "* How to implement the ID3 Decision Tree induction algorithm\n",
    "* How to implement an ensemble of decision trees using the Bagging algorithm\n",
    "* How to test algorithms using repeated hold-out validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is presented in the form of an interactive Python notebook; it contains a mix of pre-made examples to help you understand how to do things, scaffolding with missing parts where you'll write your own code, and written short-answer questions.  Your job is to fill in answers to the written questions (which may require you to modify scaffolding code and re-run it, or may require you to write your own code and run it), as well as write the indicated functions to complete the programming portion of the assignment.  Look for the red <span style=\"color:red\">TODO: ...</span> markers to help you spot places you'll need to complete things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be sure to ***remove* the TODO markers** as you complete each aspect (i.e. don't leave a TODO that's for something you've actually done, that's poor style because it's confusing to anyone reading your code/documentation/etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is intended to be done with a partner (i.e. teams of two); partners will be assigned based on the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have approximately **two weeks** to complete this lab, so be sure to start early and plan properly to get it all done in a timely fashion.  It's recommended that you start at the top and work your way down (i.e. the later parts are more difficult than the earlier ones).  As with any longer term assignment, it's a chance to train your time management skills."

    "# Constructing Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest Neighbor is a fine starting point, but no single algorithm is going to work well for all types of problems.  As a result, we'll need to use different algorithms for different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a case in point, Nearest Neighbor typically doesn't work very well for problems where the features are *discrete* variables (as opposed to *continuous*).  If the features are *ordinal*, they're discrete but at least ordered (e.g. \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"), in which case we might be able to come up with some sort of meaningful definition of a `distance()` function.  However, for *cataogrical* features there's no ordering (e.g. \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), so really all we can say is that the feature is the same or different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Decision Trees (DTs) handle discrete features very naturally; in fact, it requires a bit of extra work to get DTs to handle continuous data (it's not all *that* hard, but you won't be asked to do it for this assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SciKit Learn uses Numpy for all its data representations, which means it's actually not very good at handling discrete features.  As a result, while SKLearn does include a Decision Tree classifier, we can't actually make use of it as a baseline here, since we would first need to convert our data into numeric vectors to be able to have it run (and at that point, we wouldn't get the same result).  I've put the scores my reference implementation got down near the testing code so you've got a baseline anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also be using this as an excuse to learn about reading data from files (instead of just using data sets that come with SKLearn).\n",

    "The first thing we need to do is read some data.  Previously, we just used a data set that was built in to SciKit Learn, but this time we'll be reading a data file from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we'll use a library called **Pandas** to read our data; it's really good for reading things like excel spreadsheets and comma-separated-value (CSV) data files.  \n",

However, to get the full description of the dataset (which you'll need for the written questions at the bottom), you'll need to click on those links, and then read about the  data set.  You may also need to click the \"Data Set Description\" link near the top of the page.  This will point you to a text file with the complete data set description (note that the filename ends in '.names', but it's really just a regular text file).\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll use the `read_csv()` method to load the files; `header=none` means that the first line of the file is a normal example (as opposed to a special header with column names), and we'll use a list of strings to specify the attribute names.  Then, we just need to give it the path to the datafile and it will be loaded as a Pandas dataframe.\n",

    "# Part 3: Ensembles of Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are nice in many ways, but they have a tendency to overfit their training data.  One way to combat this tendency is to train multiple trees and then combine the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll write code to create an ensemble of decision trees using **bagging**, short for **b**ootstrap **agg**regat**ing**.  This method works by creating several different training sets, training a decision tree on each set, and then letting the resulting trees \"vote\" on the correct answer to a novel query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function to train an ensemble should take a number of trees $k$ and the fraction of the training data $f$ to use for each tree.  It should then call your `buildDecisionTree()` function $k$ times, each time using $f$ percent of the full training set selected at random _with replacement_.  If you're using Pandas, you can look at the `sample()` method (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html), which will do most of the work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should not have to actually modify your `buildDecisionTree()` function; instead, you are just calling it repeatedly with different data sets, and storing those trees to make a 'forest'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify a novel example using an ensemble, you'll need to call the single-tree classify function on that example for each tree in the ensemble; then, pick the label that got the most votes (i.e. the plurality choice) as the output for the ensemble as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll want to write a function to test your ensemble on the testing set and then try it out (you may want to copy and modify the `trainAndTestDT()` function given above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it is _**strongly recommended**_ you come up with a development plan, including a top-down design and a plan for testing your functions, _before_ you start actually writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should typically see an improvement of a couple percentage points on average for the Congress and Breast Cancer data when using bagging (e.g. for Congress I got an average of 94.5% over 10 runs using 5 trees per ensemble and 0.5 as my bagging fraction, as opposed to the 92.7% for single DTs).  The mushroom data should already be getting 100% accuracy with a single tree, so there's really no room for improvement on that one."
